## Description

Welcome to BookSStore, your go-to website for all things books! BookSStore offers a user-friendly interface that allows you to search for books using Google Books' extensive database. Whether you're looking for a new release, a classic favorite, or a specific topic, our search functionality makes it easy to find the perfect read.

One of the standout features of BookSStore is the ability to save books to your personal collection. Once you find a book that piques your interest, simply click the "Save" button, and it will be added to your saved books. This way, you can keep track of the books you want to read or have already enjoyed, creating your own virtual library.

We understand that tastes and preferences change, so we've made it convenient to manage your saved books. If you no longer wish to keep a book in your collection, BookSStore allows you to delete it with just a click. This ensures that your saved books remain curated and reflect your current reading interests.
